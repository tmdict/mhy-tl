When they possess 1/2/3 Remedy stacks, Max HP will increase by {{(12/24/40%)//(15/30/50%)//(18/36/60%)//(21/42/70%)//(24/48/80%)}}. 1 stack may be gained when the following conditions are met: 1 stack for 25s when using an Elemental Skill; 1 stack for 25s when the value of a Bond of Life value increases; 1 stack for 20s for performing healing. Stacks can still be triggered when the equipping character is not on the field. Each stackâ€™s duration is counted independently. In addition, when 3 stacks are active, Elemental Burst CRIT Rate will be increased by {{28//35//42//49//56}}. This effect will be canceled 4s after falling under 3 stacks."
