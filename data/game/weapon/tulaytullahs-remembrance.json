After the wielder unleashes an Elemental Skill, Normal Attack DMG will increase by {{4.8//6//7.2//8.4//9.6%}} every second for 14s. After hitting an opponent with a Normal Attack during this duration, Normal Attack DMG will be increased by {{9.6//12//14.4//16.8//19.2%}}. This increase can be triggered once every 0.3s. The maximum Normal Attack DMG increase per single duration of the overall effect is {{48//60//72//84//96%}}. The effect will be removed when the wielder leaves the field, and using the Elemental Skill again will reset all DMG buffs."
