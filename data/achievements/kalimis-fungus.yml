achievement: kalimis-fungus
version: "3.0"
achievementType: "wonders-of-the-world"
region: sumeru
checklist: 1
name: "Kalimi’s Fungus"
description: "Watch Hatim make a killing on the exchange!"
commission:
- "Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering"
notes: | 
  After getting the initial commission “Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering”, you will receive this achievement if the follow-up commission is the one where Hatim makes a fortune.
  
  Getting the “Bargain-Hunting” version will lead to the “When Wealth Comes A-Knockin’” achievement. Other follow-ups yield no achievements.

  Follow-up commission seems to be completely random and not affected by the type and quality of food used.
