achievementType: "wonders-of-the-world"
region: sumeru
checklist: 1
name: "When Wealth Comes A-Knockin’"
description: "Give Hatim some Apple Cider."
commission:
- "Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering"
notes: | 
  After getting the initial commission “Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering”, you will receive this achievement if the follow-up commission is the one where Hatim goes bargain-hunting.
  
  Getting the “Fortune” version will lead to the “Kalimi’s Fungus” achievement. Other follow-ups yield no achievements.

  Follow-up commission seems to be completely random and not affected by the type and quality of food used.
