notes: |
  The bug below has been fixed since 3.0 and giving Dandelion Seeds directly from the inventory now progresses the achievement.
  
  ~~Giving Dandelion Seeds directly from the inventory (instead of collecting new ones) does not counts towards the achievement. To get credit for the achievement, teleport to the Temple of the Falcon (domain Northwest of Windrise), climb above it and collect the seeds.~~
