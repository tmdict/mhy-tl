checklist: 5
name: "Love Is All Around"
commission:
- "Good Sign"
description: "In “Good Sign,” help Zhihua find 5 signs that romance is coming his way."
notes: |
  There are 5 signs but each commission will only give you two at random. Four have two possible outcomes, so at minimum you need to do this commission 5 times to unlock both achievements.

  Finding all 5 “signs of an imminent romance” grants the achievement “Love is All Around”:
  1. Seeing that Granny Shan has good business
  2. Leaving the pigeons alone
  3. Leaving the dogs alone
  4. Leaving the cat and fish alone
  5. Leaving the leaves alone

  (Ruining 4 “signs of an imminent romance” grants the hidden achievement “Open to Interpretation”)
